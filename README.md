# RubberDuckCrew 🦆

Welcome to the **RubberDuckCrew** GitHub organization — a community-driven collective focused on developing innovative, developer-friendly tools and apps with a touch of quack.  

## About RubberDuckCrew

We believe in the power of clear communication and collaborative problem solving — inspired by the classic “rubber duck debugging” technique. Our projects aim to help developers and teams work smarter, not harder.
