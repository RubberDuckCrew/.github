# RubberDuckCrew ü¶Ü

Welcome to the **RubberDuckCrew** GitHub organization with a touch of quack.

## About RubberDuckCrew ‚ÑπÔ∏è

We are a flock of computer science students paddling together through the vast ocean of code as part of a student project.
Our mission? To learn, build, and occasionally splash around while creating practical and quirky tools for developers.
We‚Äôre always open to new ideas, fresh challenges, shiny technologies - and new people from all walks of life who want to join our little pond.
If it floats, we‚Äôll try to sail it; if it sinks, we‚Äôll debug it.
At the heart of it all, we believe in teamwork, curiosity, and the occasional "quack" of inspiration.
