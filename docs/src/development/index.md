# Development

Welcome to the RubberDuckCrew development guide!

This section provides an overview of our development workflows, standards, and automation practices. By following these guidelines, you help ensure quality, consistency, and smooth collaboration across all projects in the organization.

## CI/CD

We use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to automate testing, building, and deployment. This helps us deliver reliable software quickly and efficiently.

For details on our CI/CD setup, best practices, and how to use it in your projects, see the [CI/CD guide](./ci-cd.md).

## Renovate

We use Renovate to keep our project dependencies up-to-date automatically. For details on how to set it up and configure it for your repositories, see the [Renovate guide](./renovate.md).
