# Contributing conventions

To maintain a consistent and organized codebase, we have established the following conventions for contributing to our project. Please adhere to these guidelines when making contributions.

## Commit messages

We use the [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention for commit messages. This helps us maintain clarity and consistency in our commit history.

A commit message should follow the format:

```
<intention> [scope?][:?] <message>
```

-   `<intention>`: The intention you want to express with the commit, using an emoji from the [GitMoji list](https://gitmoji.dev/). Either in the `:shortcode:` or unicode format.

-   `[scope?][:?]`: An **optional** string that adds contextual information for the scope of the change. If present, it should be followed by a colon.

-   `<message>`: A brief explanation of the change.

Examples for possible commit messages:

-   `🐛 Fix error while user image is loading`
-   `✨ Add editing todos`
-   `📝 Update README with new installation instructions`

## Branch naming

When creating branches for your contributions, please use one of the following prefixes to indicate the type of work being done. This helps in categorizing and understanding the purpose of each branch at a glance.

| Prefix      | Gitmoji | Description                                            | Example                       | Labels             |

## Labels

When creating pull requests and issues, please use the appropriate labels to categorize your changes. This helps maintainers quickly understand the nature of your contribution. The labels should match the prefixes used in branch naming.

| Label               | Description                                          | Color   | Branch Prefix |

> Note: The labels without a branch prefix are used for issues and pull requests that do not correspond to a specific branch type, such as discussions or questions.

To make sure all these labels are always up to date in each repository, we define the labels globally in [`labels.yml`](https://github.com/RubberDuckCrew/.github/blob/main/configs/conventions/labels.yml) in the `.github` repository and use a GitHub Actions workflow to synchronize them automatically to all the individual repositories. See [Sync labels](/development/ci-cd#sync-labels) for more details.
