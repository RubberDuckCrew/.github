# Contributing

Welcome to the RubberDuckCrew contributing guide!

We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether you want to:

-   Report issues
-   Request new features
-   Submit pull requests
-   Help with documentation

This section introduces our conventions and the process for working with forks. Following these guidelines helps ensure consistency, collaboration, and quality across all our projects.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please also review our [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct) before participating.

## Conventions

We use shared conventions for code style, commit messages, labels, and workflows. These conventions make it easier for everyone to contribute and review changes. You can find detailed information in the [conventions guide](./conventions).

## Verified commits

To maintain the integrity and security of our codebase, we require **all commits** to be **verified**. This ensures that the code originates from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with. You can find detailed information in the [verified commits guide](./verified-commits).

## Forks

If you want to contribute to a repository but do not have write access, you can create a fork. Forks allow you to work independently and propose changes via pull requests. For more details on how to work with forks, see the [forks guide](./forks).

By following these conventions and using forks, you help keep our projects healthy and welcoming for all contributors.
